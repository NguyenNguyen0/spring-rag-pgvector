# Spring AI RAG Demo

This project demonstrates a simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Spring AI, PGVector as the vector store, and OpenAI for embedding and chat models.

## Components

*   **Spring Boot Application:** The main application that orchestrates the RAG pipeline.
*   **PGVector:** A PostgreSQL extension used as a vector database to store and retrieve document embeddings.
*   **OpenAI Embedding Model:** Used to convert text documents and user queries into numerical vector representations.
*   **OpenAI Chat Model:** Used to generate responses based on the user's query and retrieved relevant information.
*   **DocumentLoader:** A Spring component that loads sample documents into the PGVector store on application startup.
*   **RagService:** A service that handles the RAG logic:
    *   Takes a user query.
    *   Performs a similarity search in the PGVector store to find relevant documents.
    *   Constructs a prompt for the OpenAI chat model, incorporating the original query and the retrieved document content.
    *   Returns the generated response from the OpenAI chat model.
*   **RagController:** A REST controller that exposes an endpoint (`/ai/rag`) to interact with the `RagService`.
*   **`rag-prompt.st`:** A prompt template used by the `RagService` to guide the AI model's response, ensuring it uses the provided information.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

1.  **Java 21:** Ensure you have Java 21 installed.
2.  **Gradle:** This project uses Gradle for dependency management and building.
3.  **PostgreSQL with PGVector Extension:**
    *   Install PostgreSQL.
    *   Install the `pgvector` extension. You might need to compile it from source or use a pre-built image (e.g., `pgvector/pgvector`).
    *   Create a database (e.g., `rag_demo`). `CREATE DATABASE rag_demo;`
    *   Enable the `vector` extension in your database (after connecting to your database `\c rag_demo`):
        ```sql
        CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
        CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vector_store (
            id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
            content text,
            embedding vector(768) 
        );

        CREATE INDEX ON vector_store USING HNSW (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
        ```
4.  **OpenAI API Key:** Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

### Configuration

1.  **`application.properties`:**
    *   Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your PostgreSQL connection details if they differ from the defaults.
    *   Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Alternatively, you can directly paste it into `application.properties` (not recommended for production):
        ```properties
        spring.ai.openai.api-key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
        ```

### Build and Run

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
    ```
2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
    The `DocumentLoader` will automatically load sample documents into your PGVector database on startup.

### Test the RAG Endpoint

Once the application is running, you can access the RAG endpoint:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/ai/rag?message=What is RAG?"
```

You should receive a response generated by the OpenAI chat model, augmented with information retrieved from your PGVector store.
